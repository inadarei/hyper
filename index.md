## Acknowledgments

Collection.Doc+JSON is based on [Collection+JSON](http://amundsen.com/media-types/collection/format/) hypermedia type and heavily leverages existing standards, such as: [URI Template [RFC6570]](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6570), [Home Document Specification](http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-nottingham-json-home-03) and [IANA-registered Link Relation Types](http://www.iana.org/assignments/link-relations/link-relations.xhtml), wherever possible.

It was designed by a team at [NPR](https://www.npr.org) that included: [Irakli Nadareishvili](https://twitter.com/inadarei/), [Javaun Moradi](https://twitter.com/javaun), [Randall Randall](https://github.com/randallsquared), Scott Smith, John Nelson and Kevin Moylan with valuable input and advice from [Mike Amundsen](https://github.com/mamund), [Ioseb Dzmanashvili](https://github.com/ioseb) and [Andrew Kuklewicz](https://github.com/kookster), while working on various NPR APIs and most recently: building the [Public Media Platform](http://docs.pmp.io).
